# PoWiLoc
Pollex' Wireless Locator (PoWi Locator) is a fully Open-Source device used to test LoRaWAN connections and map them on the PoWi website and/or the [TTN Mapper](https://ttnmapper.org/) website.

The locator is designed to be built by everyone who has some technical knowledge (soldering and programming) and the device has several optional features which can be left out to make assembling the device easier.

The hardware is designed in free and Open-Source software called [KiCAD](https://kicad.org/).

The source code for this device is developed in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (a lightweight editor) with the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) extension. Also both free and Open-Source. This setup is chosen instead of the Arduino IDE because it allows  for cleaner code and better library management.

## This project is in active development and contributions cannot be received at this point in time. As soon as a minimum viable product is built, contributions will open and links to documentation will be provided.
